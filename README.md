# Altium 5V Regulator PCB design

This project involves the schematic and PCB design of a 5V Voltage Regulator using commercial components and the add-on Altium Library Loader.

For the design I used capacitors, LM7805 regulator and a Schottky diode.

# Buck Converter with Altium

This project involves the schematic design and Simulation of a Buck converter of a Buck Converter with Altium, as it was assigned for my Power Electronic courses. 



### Requirements

Vin = 12V

Vout = 5V

I_load= 2A

f = 400KHz

Duty cycle = Vin/Vout = 5/12 = 0.416
